        <p>Messi is a argentine professional footballer who plays forward and captain for FC Barcelona 
        and Argentina. Messi is considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest
        players of all time. Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone 
        deficiency as a child. At age 13 he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his
        medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy,Messi made his competitive
        debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established
        himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist 
        for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following
        year. During the 2011â€“12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single
        season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer in official competitions in March
        2012.
